        placeholder="Enter your password"
        required
      />, 
      input-> element [tell browser what to display]
      id,type,placeholders -> attribute[says the element behaviour/how they should behave ]

7. It is a piece of code that gives info about our webpage. its useful for search engine like google to understand what the page is about.
